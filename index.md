> <br>
> “What if the day of His coming were tomorrow? If we knew that we would meet the Lord tomorrow—through our premature death or through His unexpected coming—what would we do today? What confessions would we make? What practices would we discontinue? What accounts would we settle? What forgivenesses would we extend? What testimonies would we bear? If we would do those things then, why not now?”  
> - Dallin H. Oaks [“Preparation for the Second Coming”, LDS General Conference, April 2004]
>  
> <br>
> “I do not believe in a God who would set up rules and commandments only to wait for us to fail so He could punish us. I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him. Even when we stumble, He urges us not to be discouraged—never to give up or flee our allotted field of service—but to take courage, find our faith, and keep trying.”
> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“Four Titles”, LDS General Conference, April 2013]
>  
> <br>
> “It is good to have goals and plans for our careers, for our education, even for our golf game. It is also important to have goals for our marriages, our families, and our Church councils and callings; this is especially true for missionaries. But our greatest and most overriding goals should fit into Heavenly Father’s eternal plan. Jesus said, ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.’”  
> - M. Russell Ballard [“Return and Receive”, LDS General Conference, April 2017]

## [Atonement](javascript:openTab('AtonementTab'))
> “Healing blessings come in many ways, each suited to our individual needs, as known to Him who loves us best. Sometimes a ‘healing’ cures our illness or lifts our burden. But sometimes we are ‘healed’ by being given strength or understanding or patience to bear the burdens placed upon us.”  
> - Dallin H. Oaks [“He Heals the Heavy Laden”, LDS General Conference, October 2006]
>  
> <br>
> “The purpose of the gospel is to transform common creatures into celestial citizens, and that requires change.”

> <br>
> “We acknowledge that your path will at times be difficult. But I give you this promise in the name of the Lord: rise up and follow in the footsteps of our Redeemer and Savior, and one day you will look back and be filled with eternal gratitude that you chose to trust the Atonement and its power to lift you up and give you strength.”  
> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“You Can Do It Now!”, LDS General Conference, October 2013]
>  
> <br>
> “Life has a way of testing our anchors and tempting us to drift. Nevertheless, if our anchors are correctly placed in the rock of our Redeemer, they will hold—no matter the force of the wind, the strength of the tide, or the height of the waves.”  
> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“A Firmly Set Anchor”, _Ensign_, April 2014]
>  
> <br>
> “The heavens will not be filled with those who never made mistakes but with those who recognized that they were off course and who corrected their ways to get back in the light of gospel truth.”  
> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“A Matter of a Few Degrees”, LDS General Conference, April 2008]
>  
> <br>
> “We cannot go back in time and change the past, but we can repent. The Savior can wipe away our tears of regret and remove the burden of our sins. His Atonement allows us to leave the past behind and move forward with clean hands, a pure heart, and a determination to do better and especially to become better.”  
> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“Of Regrets and Resolutions”, LDS General Conference, October 2012]

> “However late you think you are, however many chances you think you have missed, however many mistakes you feel you have made or talents you think you don’t have, or however far from home and family and God you feel you have traveled, I testify that you have not traveled beyond the reach of divine love. It is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ’s Atonement shines.”

> <br>
> “When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following: Stop it!”

>  
> <br>

> - Boyd K. Packer [“The Holy Temple”, _Ensign_, February 1995]
>

> - Richard G. Scott [“Blessings of the Temple”, _Ensign_, October 2010]
>  
> <br>  
> “To enter the temple is a tremendous blessing. But first we must be worthy. We should not be rushed. We cannot cut corners of preparation and risk the breaking of covenants we were not prepared to make. That would be worse than not making them at all.”  
> - Russell M. Nelson [“Personal Preparation for Temple Blessings”, LDS General Conference, April 2001]
>  
> <br>  
> “With each ordinance is a covenant—a promise. A covenant made with God is not restrictive, but protective... Covenants do not hold us down; they elevate us beyond the limits of our own power and perspective.”  
> - Russell M. Nelson [“Personal Preparation for Temple Blessings”, LDS General Conference, April 2001]

> - Russell M. Nelson [“Generations Linked in Love”, LDS General Conference, April 2010]
>  
> <br>

>  
> <br>

> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“Forget Me Not”, LDS General Conference, October 2011]
>  
> <br>

> - Dieter F. Uchtdorf [“The Love of God”, LDS General Conference, October 2009]
>  
> <br>

> - Attributed to numerous (Quoted by Lynn G. Robbins) [“Until Seventy Times Seven”, LDS General Conference, April 2018]
>  
> <br>
> “Don’t you quit. You keep walking, you keep trying, there is help and happiness ahead. … Some blessings come soon. Some come late. Some don’t come until heaven. But for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come. … It will be alright in the end. Trust God and believe in good things to come.”

>  
> <br>
> “When we face seemingly insurmountable obstacles in the fulfillment of righteous responsibilities, we should remember that when we are involved in the work of the Lord, the obstacles before us are never as great as the power behind us. We should reach out and climb. Handholds will only be found by hands that are outstretched. Footholds are only for feet that are on the move.”  
> - Dallin H. Oaks [“Reach Out and Climb!”, _New Era_, April 2002]
>  
> <br>
> “Yes, men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace. Whoever will lose his life in the service of God will find eternal life.”  
> - Ezra Taft Benson [“Jesus Christ”, _Ensign_, December 1988]
>  
> <br>  
> “The artificial boundary line we so often place between missionary work and temple and family history work is being erased; this is one great work of salvation.”
