The sour, bitter kind are improved by a pinch of salt of common sense. Spice with patience. Wrap well in a mantle of charity. Prepare over a fire of steady devotion. Serve with peaches and cream. The poorest varieties may be improved by this process and kept for years in any climate.”

I believe in a Heavenly Father who is loving and caring and who rejoices in our every effort to stand tall and walk toward Him.
